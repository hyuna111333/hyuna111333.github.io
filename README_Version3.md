# GitHub Pages site

This repository contains a static site deployed with GitHub Pages.

Place the following files in the repository root:
- index.html
- Any asset folders (e.g., css/, js/, images/) used by your page
- .nojekyll (empty file) to prevent Jekyll processing if needed

How to use
1. If you want the site at the root URL (https://hyuna111333.github.io/), create a repository named `hyuna111333.github.io` and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. If you prefer a repo-specific URL (https://hyuna111333.github.io/REPO_NAME/), use any repo name and enable Pages for that repo.

See DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md for step-by-step deployment commands.
